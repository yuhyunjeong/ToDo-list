# ToDo-list

## ✅ What I learned

### Install React app

npx create-react-app [project name]

### Components

All of the built-in browser components support some props and events.

- input
  - onChange: An Event handler function. Required for controlled inputs. Fires immediately when the input’s value is changed by the user (for example, it fires on every keystroke). Behaves like the browser input event.

### Hooks

Hooks let you use different React features from your components.

- State Hooks
  - State lets a component “remember” information like user input.
  - import { useState } from "react";

### Props

Props are arguments passed into React components via HTML attributes.

Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.

To send props into a component, use the same syntax as HTML attributes:

### Array Methods

One of the most useful in React is the .map() array method.

The .map() method allows you to run a function on each item in the array, returning a new array as the result. So, map() can be used to generate lists.

### Spread Operator

The JavaScript spread operator (...) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object
