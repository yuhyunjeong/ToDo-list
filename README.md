# ToDo-list

## ✅ What I learned

### Install React app

npx create-react-app [project name]

### Components

All of the built-in browser components support some props and events.

- <input>
    - onChange: An Event handler function. Required for controlled inputs. Fires immediately when the input’s value is changed by the user (for example, it fires on every keystroke). Behaves like the browser input event.
